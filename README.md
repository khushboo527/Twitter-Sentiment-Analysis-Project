# Name
Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Project

#Description 
This project addresses the problem of sentiment analysis in twitter; that is classifying tweets according to the 
sentiment expressed in them: positive, negative or neutral.

#Requirements
There are some general library requirements for the project and some which are specific to individual methods. 
The general requirements are as follows.

numpy
scikit-learn
scipy
nltk

The library requirements specific to some methods are:
keras with TensorFlow backend for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Perceptron, Linear SVM.

#Usage
We did some general Preprocessing On the dataset and analysized it.

#Installation
Data is loaded from
->DataSet-/content/training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv

#process 
Having a single file all the codes are there, plots and accuracies of models are explained in the report.

#Further Analysis
In further analysis the tweets were analyzed based upon emotions, which tells that which emotion has higher probability 
in positive tweets or negative tweets. After understanding how emotions and sentiment are correlated,top 10 hashtags for every emotion was found and plotted.Many
hashtags are common in all cases , however their frequency vary.
